### First run
[Places365-Standard](http://places2.csail.mit.edu/download.html) 
dataset will be downloaded and split into _train/dev/test_ subsets.
By default only 10 arbitrary categories will be considered.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kainoj/colnet.git
$ cd colnet
$ make dataset
$ make split
```

### Requirements
Code is written in Python 3.6.3. [Here](requirements.txt) are all requirements, hit the following to install:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```


### Network training
Simply run:
```bash
$ python3 loader.py config/places10.yaml
```
[`places10.yaml`](./config/places10.yaml) is a sample configuration file ‚Äì i.e. specifies 
total number of epoch, learning rate, output directories etc.
To see full .yaml configuration, `run python3 loader.py config/places10.yaml`


Checkpoints of models are saved on every epoch.
Training can be interrupted and resumed anytime.
Resume by executing:
```bash
$ python3 loader.py config/places10.yaml --model model.pt
```
where `model.pt` is a previously saved model checkpoint.

### Colorize!
Choose the most favourite model and hit:
```bash
$ python3 colorize.py img.jpg ./models/places.pt
```
